# salary-calculator

This project isn't too serious. I just wanted a nice little app to build to play with some libraries and do some maths. Feel free to make PR's.

## Setup

Install node modules `npm i` or `yarn`, the dev command will open a browser `npm start` or `yarn start` and build with `npm run build` or `yarn build`. Not used yarn, but it should work.
